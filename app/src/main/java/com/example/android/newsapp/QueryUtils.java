Movies sound full and loud, while video calls come across clearly and naturally. The front-facing camera is good, too, but the microphones aren’t great at picking up voices from a distance, meaning Google Meet calls were better done from the desk than the sofa.</p> <p>A larger version of Samsung’s excellent S Pen stylus, as seen in <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/18/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-super-priced-superphone-camera\\\">the Note series of smartphones</a>, is included in the box and magnetically attaches to the back of the tablet for storage and charging.

Models with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage are available in some regions.</p> <p>It handles any app or game with ease, plus multiple apps on screen at once. It lasts for more than 10 hours of productive work between charges when used like a laptop in Dex mode. That included having multiple tabs open in Chrome, Evernote, AI Writer, various messaging apps and lots of email, and various other bits used intermittently. That beats the 12.9in iPad Pro by two hours, when used in a similar manner. I expect you will get longer out of the tablet if just used for watching films or similar.</p> <p>The Tab S7+ came with a disappointingly low-power 10W charger, which took about three hours to fully charge the tablet, but can charge at rates of up to 45W with higher-powered adapters that can be purchased separately.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <p>Samsung declined to provide an estimate for the expected lifespan of the battery in the Tab S7+, which is typically 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity for other rechargeable batteries. The device is generally repairable and the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Battery replacements will cost no more than £59.</p> <p>Samsung declined to comment on the use of recycled materials in the Tab S7+ but does offer <a href=\\\"http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fuk%2Ftrade-in%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/19/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-the-superphone-thats-a-little-too-massive\\\">trade-in</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.samsungrecycle.co.uk/\\\">recycling schemes</a> for old devices.</p> <h2>One UI 2.5 + Dex</h2>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"33aa347ded5e94c94f83264ff38cbc99691e6a16\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33aa347ded5e94c94f83264ff38cbc99691e6a16/107_32_5349_3211/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ review\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Multi-window allows you to set up a split-screen of up to three apps at once.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tab S7+ runs Samsung’s version of Android called One UI 2.5, which is based on Android 10 and also features on the company’s recently released smartphones but not the latest <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/09/android-11-release-everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-update\\\">Android 11</a>. An update to Android 11 is expected in the next six months. Samsung has pledged three years of major Android updates and <a href=\\\"https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb\\\">quarterly security patches</a>, which is still some way behind Apple’s five-plus years of software support for its tablets.</p> <p>You can run up to three apps in a split-screen configuration and more as floating windows, much like the recent <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/21/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-a-pounds-1800-folding-phone-tablet-that-works\\\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>. Mostly it works fine but some apps refuse to run in landscape mode, forcing the tablet into portrait mode when launched.</p> <p>But to make the most out of the tablet as a work device Samsung also includes an upgraded version of its Dex system, which essentially turns Android into a desktop-like computer complete with apps in windows, full mouse and keyboard support, a task bar at the bottom of the screen and other elements similar to Windows or macOS.</p> <p>Dex works very well within the confines of Android. Most apps can be used in windows and resized just fine. Samsung’s own apps all run fine but even those third-party apps that work in Dex have quirks that you have to adapt to. Some don’t like being resized and effectively quit and relaunch when you expand or shrink their windows, which can get annoying if the app is protected by a pin or similar. Other apps, including password manager LastPass, simply won’t run in Dex mode, which made it a hard sell for my particular usage.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ review\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Dex opens Android apps into their own windows on a desktop-like experience ready for a keyboard and mouse.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chrome on Android is also not good enough to be a desktop browser. It struggles with heavy web apps and doesn’t support drag and drop, which means some of the systems I use for work do not operate correctly. Right click is also hit-and-miss and it’s hard to select text with a mouse.</p> <p>To make the most of Dex you need a keyboard and mouse. Third-party devices work well enough but really it is designed to be used with Samsung’s Keyboard Cover, which is an additional £219. The Keyboard Cover is a two-part case. A back cover attaches to the tablet via magnets and includes a good kickstand, while the keyboard attaches to the ports on the bottom of the tablet.</p> <p>The keyboard and trackpad are pretty good but the keyboard attachment to the tablet is not rigid enough to be comfortably used on a lap. It is simply nowhere near as good as the Surface Pro’s type cover keyboards, which are £100 cheaper.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"a3d6ae97a50037251581b562a8b67d26086825c0\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3d6ae97a50037251581b562a8b67d26086825c0/254_318_4949_2970/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ review\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">You can at use the back cover with the kickstand separately from the keyboard for watching movies.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Observations</h2> <ul> <li><p>The cameras are fairly good for a tablet but won’t beat a good smartphone camera.</p></li> <li><p>The S Pen has a soft-touch finish and excellent balance making it easy and comfortable to write and draw with.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ costs <a href=\\\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-s7-plus-t970/SM-T970NZNAEUA/buy/\\\">£799</a> with just wifi or <a href=\\\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-s7-plus-5g-t976/SM-T976BZNAEUA/buy/\\\">£999</a> with 5G connectivity.</p> <p>The S Pen is included in the box but the Keyboard Cover costs an additional <a href=\\\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/mobile-accessories/galaxy-tab-s7-plus-keyboard-cover-dt970/\\\">£219</a>.</p> <p>The smaller 11in Galaxy Tab S7 costs <a href=\\\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-s7-t870/SM-T870NZNAEUA/buy/\\\">£619</a>.</p> <p>For comparison, Apple’s iPad has an RRP of <a href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2\\\">£329</a>, the iPad Air costs <a href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air\\\">£579</a>, the 11in iPad Pro costs <a href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro\\\">£769</a>, the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/10/apple-2020-ipad-pro-129in-review-best-mobile-tablet-can-now-get-real-work-done\\\">12.9in iPad Pro</a> costs <a href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro\\\">£969</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/23/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-the-best-windows-10-tablet-pc-computer\\\">Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7</a> costs <a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-7/8n17j0m5zzqs?activetab=overview\\\">£719</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>There’s no doubt the Galaxy Tab S7+ is the best tablet Samsung has ever made. It is leagues ahead of the company’s previous efforts and most definitely the best Android tablet you can buy, too.</p> <p>But despite all the software additions Samsung has made to Android to make it a more powerful work machine, it falls short of being a good laptop or Windows tablet replacement. Apps can be unpredictable, unstable or simply don’t work when in Dex mode. That’s fine for casual things but if an app quits and loses work, that’s simply not acceptable.</p> <p>The iPad Pro has its own problems as a PC-replacement but app instability isn’t one of them.

The new tablet comes in two sizes: the 11in Tab S7 costing £619 and the 12.4in Tab S7+ costing £799, as reviewed here. Intended to compete with Apple’s top iPad Pro, it looks very similar in design. The 12.4in OLED screen is simply fantastic, rivalling the very best OLED TVs let alone smartphones and tablets. It has iPad Pro-like thin bezels around the edge of the display, flat metal sides, rounded corners and even antenna lines crisscrossing the metal back.\\nThe screen has a 16:10 ratio, making it much wider than an iPad with its 4:3 ratio and more like a Microsoft Surface Pro. The Tab S7+ has four Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers in the sides, which give stereo sound in either portrait or landscape orientation. Movies sound full and loud, while video calls come across clearly and naturally. The front-facing camera is good, too, but the microphones aren’t great at picking up voices from a distance, meaning Google Meet calls were better done from the desk than the sofa. A larger version of Samsung’s excellent S Pen stylus, as seen in the Note series of smartphones, is included in the box and magnetically attaches to the back of the tablet for storage and charging. The stylus is excellent with pressure sensitivity, tilt support and low latency but having it attached to the back is a bit awkward.\\nSpecifications Screen: 12.4in WQXGA+ Super AMOLED Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ RAM: 6GB of RAM Storage: 128GB + microSD card slot Operating system: One UI 2.5 based on Android 10 Camera: Dual rear camera: 13MP+5MP; 8MP selfie camera Connectivity: USB-C, S Pen, wifi 6 (5G optional), Bluetooth 5 and location Water resistance: none Dimensions: 185 x 285 x 5.7mm Weight: 575g Good performance and battery\\nThe Tab S7+ has Qualcomm’s latest top Snapdragon 865+ processor and 6GB of RAM, meaning it is the highest performing Android tablet available. Models with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage are available in some regions. It handles any app or game with ease, plus multiple apps on screen at once. It lasts for more than 10 hours of productive work between charges when used like a laptop in Dex mode. That included having multiple tabs open in Chrome, Evernote, AI Writer, various messaging apps and lots of email, and various other bits used intermittently. That beats the 12.9in iPad Pro by two hours, when used in a similar manner. I expect you will get longer out of the tablet if just used for watching films or similar. The Tab S7+ came with a disappointingly low-power 10W charger, which took about three hours to fully charge the tablet, but can charge at rates of up to 45W with higher-powered adapters that can be purchased separately. Sustainability Samsung declined to provide an estimate for the expected lifespan of the battery in the Tab S7+, which is typically 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity for other rechargeable batteries. The device is generally repairable and the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Battery replacements will cost no more than £59. Samsung declined to comment on the use of recycled materials in the Tab S7+ but does offer trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. One UI 2.5 + Dex\\nThe Tab S7+ runs Samsung’s version of Android called One UI 2.5, which is based on Android 10 and also features on the company’s recently released smartphones but not the latest Android 11. An update to Android 11 is expected in the next six months. Samsung has pledged three years of major Android updates and quarterly security patches, which is still some way behind Apple’s five-plus years of software support for its tablets. You can run up to three apps in a split-screen configuration and more as floating windows, much like the recent Galaxy Z Fold 2. Mostly it works fine but some apps refuse to run in landscape mode, forcing the tablet into portrait mode when launched. But to make the most out of the tablet as a work device Samsung also includes an upgraded version of its Dex system, which essentially turns Android into a desktop-like computer complete with apps in windows, full mouse and keyboard support, a task bar at the bottom of the screen and other elements similar to Windows or macOS. Dex works very well within the confines of Android. Most apps can be used in windows and resized just fine. Samsung’s own apps all run fine but even those third-party apps that work in Dex have quirks that you have to adapt to. Some don’t like being resized and effectively quit and relaunch when you expand or shrink their windows, which can get annoying if the app is protected by a pin or similar. Other apps, including password manager LastPass, simply won’t run in Dex mode, which made it a hard sell for my particular usage.\\nChrome on Android is also not good enough to be a desktop browser. It struggles with heavy web apps and doesn’t support drag and drop, which means some of the systems I use for work do not operate correctly. Right click is also hit-and-miss and it’s hard to select text with a mouse. To make the most of Dex you need a keyboard and mouse. Third-party devices work well enough but really it is designed to be used with Samsung’s Keyboard Cover, which is an additional £219. The Keyboard Cover is a two-part case. A back cover attaches to the tablet via magnets and includes a good kickstand, while the keyboard attaches to the ports on the bottom of the tablet. The keyboard and trackpad are pretty good but the keyboard attachment to the tablet is not rigid enough to be comfortably used on a lap. It is simply nowhere near as good as the Surface Pro’s type cover keyboards, which are £100 cheaper.\\nObservations The cameras are fairly good for a tablet but won’t beat a good smartphone camera. The S Pen has a soft-touch finish and excellent balance making it easy and comfortable to write and draw with. Price The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ costs £799 with just wifi or £999 with 5G connectivity. The S Pen is included in the box but the Keyboard Cover costs an additional £219. The smaller 11in Galaxy Tab S7 costs £619. For comparison, Apple’s iPad has an RRP of £329, the iPad Air costs £579, the 11in iPad Pro costs £769, the 12.9in iPad Pro costs £969 and Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 costs £719. Verdict There’s no doubt the Galaxy Tab S7+ is the best tablet Samsung has ever made. It is leagues ahead of the company’s previous efforts and most definitely the best Android tablet you can buy, too. But despite all the software additions Samsung has made to Android to make it a more powerful work machine, it falls short of being a good laptop or Windows tablet replacement. Apps can be unpredictable, unstable or simply don’t work when in Dex mode. That’s fine for casual things but if an app quits and loses work, that’s simply not acceptable. The iPad Pro has its own problems as a PC-replacement but app instability isn’t one of them. Chrome on Android also isn’t up to the task of being a proper desktop browser, not in the same way the iPad’s Safari. That’s not to say the Tab S7+ isn’t a fantastic gaming, video-watching, casual browsing and entertainment device – it really is the best tablet you can buy for media consumption. The screen, the battery life, the performance, the design and build are all top-notch, and the S Pen is excellent. But £799 is an awful lot of money for a media consumption tablet and if you add the £219 Keyboard Case, £1,018 puts it next to tablets and computers it can’t match for getting work done. The Galaxy Tab S7+ is the best Android tablet available. It just can’t beat Apple’s iPad Pro or Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 for work. Pros: fantastic screen, great performance and battery, good speakers, good webcam, USB-C, microSD card slot, Dex, split-screen, good fingerprint scanner, S Pen. Cons: expensive, keyboard case expensive accessory, not all apps support Dex mode, some apps quit or crash when resizing, mouse support is inconsistent, no headphone socket.\\nOther reviews Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review: super-priced superphone Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 review: a £1,800 folding phone-tablet that works Apple 2020 iPad Pro 12.9in review: the best mobile tablet can now get real work done Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review: the best Windows 10 tablet PC you can buy Surface Go 2 review: Microsoft’s smaller, cheaper Windows 10 tablet\",\"attributes\":{},\"published\":true,\"createdDate\":\"2020-09-23T15:30:37Z\",\"firstPublishedDate\":\"2020-09-23T15:56:52Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2020-09-25T11:52:02Z\",\"lastModifiedDate\":\"2020-09-25T11:52:01Z\",\"contributors\":[],\"elements\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"assets\":[],\"textTypeData\":{\"html\":\"<p>The Galaxy Tab S7+ is Samsung’s unreserved attempt to beat Apple’s iPad Pro with an Android tablet designed just as much for work as it is for play.</p> \\n<p>The new tablet comes in two sizes: the 11in Tab S7 costing £619 and the 12.4in Tab S7+ costing £799, as reviewed here.</p> \\n<p>Intended to compete with <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/10/apple-2020-ipad-pro-129in-review-best-mobile-tablet-can-now-get-real-work-done\\\">Apple’s top iPad Pro</a>, it looks very similar in design.

An update to Android 11 is expected in the next six months. Samsung has pledged three years of major Android updates and <a href=\\\"https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb\\\">quarterly security patches</a>, which is still some way behind Apple’s five-plus years of software support for its tablets.</p> \\n<p>You can run up to three apps in a split-screen configuration and more as floating windows, much like the recent <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/21/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-a-pounds-1800-folding-phone-tablet-that-works\\\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>. Mostly it works fine but some apps refuse to run in landscape mode, forcing the tablet into portrait mode when launched.</p> \\n<p>But to make the most out of the tablet as a work device Samsung also includes an upgraded version of its Dex system, which essentially turns Android into a desktop-like computer complete with apps in windows, full mouse and keyboard support, a task bar at the bottom of the screen and other elements similar to Windows or macOS.</p> \\n<p>Dex works very well within the confines of Android. Most apps can be used in windows and resized just fine. Samsung’s own apps all run fine but even those third-party apps that work in Dex have quirks that you have to adapt to. Some don’t like being resized and effectively quit and relaunch when you expand or shrink their windows, which can get annoying if the app is protected by a pin or similar. Other apps, including password manager LastPass, simply won’t run in Dex mode, which made it a hard sell for my particular usage.</p>\"}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"assets\":[{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/5229.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":5229,\"height\":3138}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/master/5229.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":5229,\"height\":3138,\"isMaster\":true}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/2000.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":2000,\"height\":1200}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/1000.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":600}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/500.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":500,\"height\":300}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4/177_153_5229_3138/140.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":140,\"height\":84}}],\"imageTypeData\":{\"caption\":\"Dex opens Android apps into their own windows on a desktop-like experience ready for a keyboard and mouse.\",\"displayCredit\":true,\"credit\":\"Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\",\"source\":\"The Guardian\",\"photographer\":\"Samuel Gibbs\",\"alt\":\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ review\",\"mediaId\":\"1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4\",\"mediaApiUri\":\"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/1cc18c6a535d39752e243c316eb56d836df32be4\",\"imageType\":\"Photograph\"}},{\"type\":\"text\",\"assets\":[],\"textTypeData\":{\"html\":\"<p>Chrome on Android is also not good enough to be a desktop browser.

It is leagues ahead of the company’s previous efforts and most definitely the best Android tablet you can buy, too.</p> \\n<p>But despite all the software additions Samsung has made to Android to make it a more powerful work machine, it falls short of being a good laptop or Windows tablet replacement. Apps can be unpredictable, unstable or simply don’t work when in Dex mode. That’s fine for casual things but if an app quits and loses work, that’s simply not acceptable.</p> \\n<p>The iPad Pro has its own problems as a PC-replacement but app instability isn’t one of them. Chrome on Android also isn’t up to the task of being a proper desktop browser, not in the same way the iPad’s Safari.</p> \\n<p>That’s not to say the Tab S7+ isn’t a fantastic gaming, video-watching, casual browsing and entertainment device – it really is the best tablet you can buy for media consumption. The screen, the battery life, the performance, the design and build are all top-notch, and the S Pen is excellent.</p> \\n<p>But £799 is an awful lot of money for a media consumption tablet and if you add the £219 Keyboard Case, £1,018 puts it next to tablets and computers it can’t match for getting work done.</p> \\n<p>The Galaxy Tab S7+ is the best Android tablet available. It just can’t beat <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/10/apple-2020-ipad-pro-129in-review-best-mobile-tablet-can-now-get-real-work-done\\\">Apple’s iPad Pro</a> or <a

It copes well with low and bright light, adjusting brightness accordingly, including a super-bright outdoors mode that comes on automatically. You can set the screen to be on all the time with a large array of attractive watch faces available, most of which are customisable.

The £399 Galaxy Watch 3 comes in two sizes (41mm or 45mm), two colours and with or without 4G, aiming to be the Apple Watch of Android, here reviewed in black with a 45mm case. It sits alongside the smaller, fitness-focused Galaxy Watch Active 2 and works with any brand of Android with access to the Google Play Store as well as an iPhone running iOS 9 or newer. The Watch 3 takes the design of 2018’s Galaxy Watch – there was no number two – and slims down its stainless steel body in all dimensions while adding a larger screen. The result is a thin, attractive traditional-looking circular watch that’s only 11.1mm thick and 53.8g in weight.\\nThe 1.4in screen is large, crisp and bright. It copes well with low and bright light, adjusting brightness accordingly, including a super-bright outdoors mode that comes on automatically. You can set the screen to be on all the time with a large array of attractive watch faces available, most of which are customisable. There are thousands more in the Galaxy Store, too. The rotating bezel around the screen acts as a jog controller for navigating the interface. Two buttons take care of back and apps functions. Press and hold the top apps button to activate Samsung Pay and the bottom back button to activate Bixby or your choice of app. Double press the bottom button to see recently used apps. The Watch 3 is water resistant to 50 metres, the screen is covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass DX and the straps are standard 20mm or 22mm bands with quick-release pins. It ships with a high-quality leather strap that is much more supple and nicer than those that come with most watches.\\nSpecifications Screen: 1.2in or 1.4in AMOLED (364 ppi) Case size: 41 or 45mm Case thickness: 11.3 or 11.1mm Band size: standard 20 or 22mm Weight: 48.2g or 53.8g Processor: Samsung Exynos 9110 dual-core 1.15GHz RAM: 1GB Storage: 8GB Operating system: Tizen 5.5 (One UI 2) Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: barometer, gyro, HR sensor, light sensor, microphone, speaker, NFC, GPS Connectivity: Bluetooth 5, wifi n, NFC Slick performance, 1.5-days battery\\nSamsung has used the same in-house Exynos 9110 processor in all of its recent smartwatches to great effect, including Watch 3. It has slightly more RAM at 1GB and double the storage at 8GB compared with the Watch Active 2 but performs very similarly. The interface is slick, snappy and lag-free. Screens and widgets whizz by as fast as you can turn the bezel. It is very close to the performance you get out of Apple Watch and far, far better than any Wear OS watch. Battery life is also solid but slightly less than the two days of the previous Galaxy Watch, mainly because of the lower-capacity battery. With the screen on all the time I routinely made it from 8am to midnight with at least 40% left. On some lighter-use days I made it to bed with 50% left. The original Galaxy Watch would end the day with closer to 60% battery left. A 20-minute run with high-accuracy tracking consumed 6% of the battery, while sleep tracking for eight hours drained the battery by 9%.

Similar batteries typically last at least 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity. Unlike many smartwatches the battery in the Watch 3 can be replaced by authorised service centres. The Watch 3 is also one of the more repairable smartwatches available, scoring a seven out of 10 with repair specialists iFixit, but Samsung did not comment on the use of recycled materials in the construction of the watch. Tizen 5.5 with One UI 2.0\\nSamsung uses its own operating system on its smartwatches called Tizen, here in its latest form with One UI 2.0. The firm offers software updates for its smartwatches for extended periods, which has resulted in watches four years old or more receiving updates recently and bodes well for the Watch 3. Tizen is based around a rotary interface, taking full advantage of that rotating bezel and circular screen, but it can also be swiped and tapped with fingers on the screen. It operates exactly the same as the Galaxy Watch Active 2 with minor improvements and slicker animations. Notifications appear as tiles to the left of the watch face and can be tapped to expand, actioned or replied to from your wrist. Widgets for various things are to the right. Swipe down from the top for quick settings or press the apps button for a list of apps. There are only a handful of good third-party apps, but they include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify with offline music downloads and playback. Samsung Pay and Bixby\\nThe Watch 3 has Samsung Pay for contactless payments, which works well if a little clunkier than Google Pay, but UK bank support is limited. I use a Curve card, which is supported by Samsung Pay, to bind my unsupported bank cards and use them through it. Samsung recently launched its own version of the Curve card called Samsung Pay Card, too. Bixby is Samsung’s smart voice assistant. It works fine for simple tasks such as setting timers and other bits but can be a bit slow to activate and understand what you have said. It is more reliable than the previous version but is still the least polished bit of the Watch 3. Samsung Health\\nSamsung Health has the same comprehensive health and fitness tracking features as it does on the Watch Active 2. It is one of the most complete suites of general health and fitness related monitoring on a smartwatch, including sleep tracking with blood oxygenation, stress and heart health, rivalling that from Apple and far better than Wear OS or rivals. Running tracking has new dynamics analysis, giving you a breakdown of your form, including asymmetry, foot contact time, flight time, regularity, vertical motion and stiffness. I’m not sure they will convince hard-core runners but it’s an interesting feature to have. Vo2 Max – a fairly common measure of cardiorespiratory fitness – matched my long-term readings from various Garmin devices on first run, which bodes well. The one negative is that it’s difficult to see when the watch has a GPS lock when preparing for a run, as it just tells you to set off. That resulted in it missing out on 200 metres of a run compared with a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar. The Watch 3 has the hardware to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and to monitor blood pressure but it has yet to be activated in the UK pending regulatory approval, which was recently granted in the US. Observations\\nOccasionally the watch would get stuck in outdoor screen mode for a bit on max brightness The short, sharp vibrations for notifications are some of the best outside of the Apple Watch. The Watch 3 can be used with an iPhone but there are significant limitations around Messages notifications and replies, lack of Samsung Pay, some Health and other functions. Pairing and set up is faster on a Samsung phone but all the functions work just fine with any modern Android phone. Price The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 comes in 41mm versions with a RRP costing £399 or 45mm versions costing £419. Versions that support 4G networking as well as Bluetooth and wifi cost an extra £40. For comparison, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 has an RRP of £269, the Fossil Gen 5 costs £279, the Fitbit Versa 2 costs £199.99 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399. Verdict The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is the best smartwatch for Android by some margin, taking the crown from the already excellent Watch Active 2. It combines a slim, light and attractive traditional watch design with the excellent rotating bezel controller, a slick software experience, solid battery life and a bright, crisp and gorgeous always-on screen. Its health-tracking features are up there with the best. Notification handling on Android is good. There is an enormous selection of watch faces and while third-party apps are slim on the ground, they do include some key ones such as Spotify and Strava. Samsung offers long-term software support, the watch is repairable and the battery can be replaced if needed. But the Watch 3 isn’t perfect. Bixby still isn’t great, Samsung Pay support is limited in the UK and while it has the hardware to support them, the ECG or blood pressure functions are still pending approval. I also wouldn’t wholly recommend using one with an iPhone as there are significant limitations compared with an Apple Watch of a similar price. It is relatively expensive but if you want a great smartwatch for your Android phone, the Galaxy Watch 3 is it. If you want something cheaper, the Watch Active 2 is almost as good. Pros: slim and attractive traditional watch design, big and bright screen, bezel control, slick performance, solid battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50-metre water resistance, standard 20mm/22mm straps, long software support, battery can be replaced, cross platform.

Notification handling on Android is good. There is an enormous selection of watch faces and while third-party apps are slim on the ground, they do include some key ones such as Spotify and Strava.</p> \\n<p>Samsung offers long-term software support, the watch is repairable and the battery can be replaced if needed. But the Watch 3 isn’t perfect. Bixby still isn’t great, Samsung Pay support is limited in the UK and while it has the hardware to support them, the ECG or blood pressure functions are still pending approval.</p> \\n<p>I also wouldn’t wholly recommend using one with an iPhone as there are significant limitations compared with an Apple Watch of a similar price.</p> \\n<p>It is relatively expensive but if you want a great smartwatch for your Android phone, the Galaxy Watch 3 is it. If you want something cheaper, the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/13/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-best-smartwatch-for-android\\\">Watch Active 2</a> is almost as good.</p> \\n<blockquote> \\n <p><strong>Pros:</strong> slim and attractive traditional watch design, big and bright screen, bezel control, slick performance, solid battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50-metre water resistance, standard 20mm/22mm straps, long software support, battery can be replaced, cross platform.</p> \\n <p><strong>Cons:</strong> few UK banks support Samsung Pay, Bixby is weak, cannot display animated images in smart camera notifications, limited functionality with an iPhone, cannot use ECG/blood pressure yet.</p>

Announced at the end of February, Android 11 brings with it enhanced privacy, new chat-related features and smarter media and device controls, as well as some Pixel-exclusive additions. Here’s what you need to know about the Android update. When can I get it? Right now if you have a Google Pixel smartphone, or one of a small selection of third-party devices made by OnePlus, Oppo, Realme and Xiaomi. Anyone owning a smartphone from another manufacturer such as Samsung is likely to have to wait a couple of months. How much will it cost? The update is free from Google and other manufacturers. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is likely to be a scam. Will my apps work? Android 11 has not changed the way the core operating system works, which means almost all apps should work fine straight out of the box if they have been updated in the last couple of years. Conversation upgrade\\nFor many, phones are all about messaging via myriad different apps. These chat apps are getting their own dedicated space within the notification section of your phone, making it easier to see and manage conversations without interfering with the rest of your notifications. Bubbles aka Chat Heads\\nFacebook first introduced a feature called Chat Heads for its Messenger app in 2013, which put conversations into little floating bubbles that sat above everything else on your screen and could be expanded to read. Google has taken that feature and made it a core part of Android so that any messaging app can do the same with a setting called Bubbles. Most chat apps will support the feature, although some need to be updated to do so. The idea is you can continue doing whatever it was you were doing while also having a quick conversation with someone without having to switch into and out of different apps. Upgraded media controls\\nMusic controls are now part of the main quick-controls section of the pull-down notification shade, sitting above the rest of the notifications. Part of the upgrade is the ability to quickly switch the output for your music, so if you’re listening on headphones but want to play a track for a friend you can simply tap the icon above the play/pause button to switch to the phone speaker. Much faster access to smart devices If you have smart lights and other devices, this upgrade is for you. Long pressing on the power button will now take you to a quick access panel where you can turn off your phone, reboot it, access Google Pay, and see a collection of quick action buttons for turning smart devices on or off. The buttons can be changed so you have only your frequently needed devices such as your thermostat or front-door light, which makes it much faster than having to open a separate app just to turn a light off. Better privacy permissions Following on from Android 10’s location-privacy upgrades, Android 11 adds far greater control over the general permissions you grant to your apps. For instance, access to the microphone, camera or location can now be granted for just one time, allowing you to use an app without granting it indefinite permission. Android will also reset the permissions granted to apps you haven’t used in a long time, notifying you when this happens, which will help avoid apps you use once and forget about being able to access parts of your phone you’d rather they didn’t. Faster updates Google is continuing its push for faster updates by making more security and privacy upgrades available via Google Play in a similar way to apps. This way you don’t have to wait for your smartphone manufacturer to push out a full phone update to get a crucial security patch. Pixel exclusives\\nIn addition to the general Android 11 updates, Google has a selection of new features specifically for its Pixel smartphones, which may come to other manufacturer’s devices at some point in the future. Live View for location sharing in Google Maps now allows you to view where your friends are in augmented reality. Simply point your phone in their general direction and it’ll show you where they are with virtual pins using your phone’s camera. Smart reply has been upgraded to suggest fully automated responses to messages in chat apps using on-device machine learning. Soon it’ll just be your phones talking to each other without any need for human interaction.

Since release in 2019, the Active 2 has received a series of updates that have improved various aspects of the watch. The firm has also offered long-term software updates to previous watches, which bodes well for new models coming this year.</p> <p>Tizen is based on a rotary interface, which makes the most of round watch screens, but can also be swiped with your finger.</p> <p>Notifications appear in tiles to the left of the watch face while widgets including music controls are on the right. Swipe down from the top for quick settings. Press the apps button on the side of the watch to bring up a ring of app icons, which you can tap or scroll around using the bezel.</p> <p>Tap a notification to expand and scroll through text, or swipe up to dismiss. You can action the notification with the same options you’d have on your phone or quick reply to messages using canned responses, a T9-like keyboard, drawing letters on screen or dictation. It all works really well.</p> <p>There are only a handful of third-party apps, but that does include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify which includes offline music downloads and playback.</p> <h2>Samsung Pay and Bixby</h2>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"0e39128355a9325439cf70609c6226fbfe317374\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e39128355a9325439cf70609c6226fbfe317374/447_543_3950_2371/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">When Bixby works, it’s perfectly capable of doing simple things such as setting timers and alarms, but forget trying to ask things such as the top speed of an African swallow.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Active 2 has contactless payments, but it’s limited to Samsung Pay, which has <a href=\\\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/samsung-pay/\\\">very little support in the UK</a> compared with Google Pay or Apple Pay. None of my credit or debit cards are supported.</p> <p>Samsung’s voice assistant, Bixby, is the least polished bit of the Active 2. You can set timers, alarms, turn features on or off, start workouts, ask for the weather and other bits, but you cannot ask general knowledge questions. It also fails to activate sometimes, fails to understand more often than competitors and a recent update to Bixby broke it entirely requiring a full reset of the watch to fix.</p> <h2>Samsung Health</h2>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"c77f16758d29cd93ed1727a24b985d5ceb2e6dec\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77f16758d29cd93ed1727a24b985d5ceb2e6dec/335_487_4350_2611/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Samsung Health ticks almost every box when it comes to health and fitness tracking, including stress monitoring with guiding breathing exercises.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samsung Health is most comprehensive health-tracking services available and is built into the Active 2.</p> <p>It has all the usual features: constant heart rate, stress, steps, floors climbed, activity and menstrual cycle. But it also has hydration, caffeine, weight and sleep.</p> <p>Sleep tracking is good, matching data from a mattress-based tracker.

The Galaxy Watch Active 2 starts at £269, costing £289 as reviewed here, and is the firm’s 10th smartwatch. Samsung has been making smartwatches since 2013 and it shows – the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the most polished this side of the Apple Watch Series 5. Slim and sleek design\\nThe Active 2 comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, both measuring 10.9mm thick. The 44mm version weighs just 30g without the strap, which is 6.5g lighter than the aluminium 44mm Apple Watch Series 5 and just one-third the weight of the Fossil Gen 5. It has a large, crisp and bright OLED screen that’s easily readable outdoors, plus an excellent selection of digital and analogue watch faces, and a large store of third-party offerings too. The thin bezel around the edge of the screen has a neat trick: it is touch sensitive and acts like a rotary controller similar to the spinning bezels on previous Samsung smartwatches. Slide your finger around the edge to scroll through lists, between screens or adjust numbers, with little vibration clicks for each increment. It’s a simple and effective control scheme that is well integrated into the whole of the system unlike digital crowns in Wear OS. Taps, swipes, a physical back button and an apps button take care of the rest. The Active 2 is water-resistant to a depth of 50 metres, and has a special water mode for preventing accidental activation and clearing the speaker of liquid when you come out. The watch comes with a high quality silicone strap, and takes standard 20mm watch bands.\\nSpecifications Screen: 1.2in or 1.4in AMOLED (364 ppi) Case size: 40 or 44mm Case thickness: 10.9mm Band size: standard 20mm Weight: 26g or 30g Processor: Samsung Exynos 9110 dual-core 1.15GHz RAM: 0.75GB Storage: 4GB Operating system: Tizen 4.0 (One UI 1.5) Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: barometer, gyro, HR sensor, light sensor, microphone, speaker, NFC, GPS Connectivity: Bluetooth 5, wifi Slick performance and battery life\\nSamsung makes both the hardware and the software for its smartwatches and it really pays off. Performance all round is fast, snappy and lag-free. It’s considerably better than even the best Wear OS watches, and very close to the slick experience Apple offers. With the screen on all the time, I easily get more than two days battery out of the Active 2, even with a 25-minute run or a two-hour walk tracked in high-accuracy mode. The Active 2 wirelessly charges in just under two hours using a puck that magnetically attaches to the back of the watch. You can also charge the watch from the back of a Samsung smartphone with Powershare and with compatible wireless chargers.\\nThe watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth, but can also remotely connect through wifi when out of range. The connection was strong and reliable, managed by the Samsung Galaxy Wearable app, which handles pairing, settings, apps and other bits. You can connect Bluetooth headphones directly to the watch to play music and listen to alerts without a phone too. Calls can also be taken directly on the watch, which works surprisingly well. Sustainability The Active 2 is generally repairable by authorised service centres, with diagnostics costing £15 outside of the one-year warranty and screen repairs costing in excess of £100. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. Tizen\\nSamsung’s smartwatches run the firm’s own Tizen operating system, rather than Google’s Wear OS or Android. Since release in 2019, the Active 2 has received a series of updates that have improved various aspects of the watch. The firm has also offered long-term software updates to previous watches, which bodes well for new models coming this year. Tizen is based on a rotary interface, which makes the most of round watch screens, but can also be swiped with your finger. Notifications appear in tiles to the left of the watch face while widgets including music controls are on the right. Swipe down from the top for quick settings. Press the apps button on the side of the watch to bring up a ring of app icons, which you can tap or scroll around using the bezel. Tap a notification to expand and scroll through text, or swipe up to dismiss. You can action the notification with the same options you’d have on your phone or quick reply to messages using canned responses, a T9-like keyboard, drawing letters on screen or dictation. It all works really well. There are only a handful of third-party apps, but that does include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify which includes offline music downloads and playback. Samsung Pay and Bixby\\nThe Active 2 has contactless payments, but it’s limited to Samsung Pay, which has very little support in the UK compared with Google Pay or Apple Pay. None of my credit or debit cards are supported. Samsung’s voice assistant, Bixby, is the least polished bit of the Active 2. You can set timers, alarms, turn features on or off, start workouts, ask for the weather and other bits, but you cannot ask general knowledge questions. It also fails to activate sometimes, fails to understand more often than competitors and a recent update to Bixby broke it entirely requiring a full reset of the watch to fix. Samsung Health\\nSamsung Health is most comprehensive health-tracking services available and is built into the Active 2. It has all the usual features: constant heart rate, stress, steps, floors climbed, activity and menstrual cycle. But it also has hydration, caffeine, weight and sleep. Sleep tracking is good, matching data from a mattress-based tracker. Workout tracking is equally comprehensive, including walking, running, hiking, cycling, swimming, circuits, weights, yoga, loads of calisthenics and various gym machines. For running, you get many of the same options you get from a lower-end dedicated running watch. You can customise the information on screen, set targets for distance, time, calories, set up guides or laps and have the watch automatically pause when you do. The back button pauses or starts the run, which is better than using a touchscreen. The GPS-trace, pace and heart rate readings in high-accuracy mode in suburban London were similar to a Garmin Forerunner 245 too. The watch has the hardware to perform an ECG, but it’s currently disabled pending an update with no timescale. The firm recently won regulatory approval in South Korea for a blood pressure monitoring system, which is expected to roll out there later this year. Observations\\nThe watch would not charge from the back of a OnePlus 8 Pro or a Belkin Qi wireless charging pad. The short, sharp vibrations for notifications and haptics are some of the best outside of the Apple Watch. There were playback and/or volume control issues with some headphones including Apple’s Beats and AirPods, and AfterShokz’s Aeropex. The Active 2 can be used with an iPhone but has limited functions compared to Android. I found it difficult to get size right with the silicone strap. Nest and Ring smart camera alerts fail to show an image on the watch with the notification, but Arlo’s similar cameras show images just fine. Price The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 comes in either 40mm or 44mm sizes and with or without 4G connectivity. The Bluetooth aluminium version costs £269 for 40mm and £289 for 44mm. The stainless steel 4G versions cost £399 for 40mm and £419 for 44mm. Other branded versions are available. Verdict The Galaxy Watch Active 2 might not actually run Android, but that’s to its benefit. As Google’s Wear OS has stagnated, Samsung has steadily improved Tizen and provided updates for its existing watches for years. The Active 2 is light, well-made, small with a large, bright, always-on screen. There are plenty of watch faces to choose from, the battery lasts two days and apps such as Strava and offline Spotify are actually good.

But a few niggles such as poor support for Samsung Pay in the UK, Bixby and some notification oddities hold it back from being a five-star product. It can be used with an iPhone, but the Apple Watch is miles better on iOS. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the best all-round smartwatch you can get for Android. Pros: slim, big and bright screen, lightweight, slick performance, long battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50 metre water resistance, standard 20mm straps, long software support, cross platform. Cons: poor contactless payment support, Bixby is poor, issues with some smart camera notifications from some manufacturers, limited functionality with an iPhone.\\nOther reviews Fossil Gen 5 review: Google’s Wear OS smartwatch at its best Apple Watch Series 5 review: the king of smartwatches\",\"attributes\":{},\"published\":true,\"createdDate\":\"2020-05-11T11:19:28Z\",\"firstPublishedDate\":\"2020-05-11T11:19:30Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2020-05-12T20:05:06Z\",\"lastModifiedDate\":\"2020-05-12T20:05:06Z\",\"contributors\":[],\"elements\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"assets\":[],\"textTypeData\":{\"html\":\"<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 may not run Android, but it is the best Android-compatible smartwatch available.</p> \\n<p>The Galaxy Watch Active 2 starts at £269, costing £289 as reviewed here, and is the firm’s 10th smartwatch.

If not enough Android users are in any given community, iPhones will eventually stop broadcasting the signals required for the app to work.</p> <p>“The workarounds NHSX on both iOS and Android are using to create a centralised database seem to be fragile, disruptive to users and risk apps not registering contacts when they should,” said Michael Veale, a privacy expert at UCL.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-atom\\\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\\\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\\\"         data-atom-type=\\\"qanda\\\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>“iOS apps are forbidden from using Bluetooth for long after they are minimised.

Perhaps you are infectious, in which case you can protect your friends and family; but perhaps you aren’t, in which case you still know that the infection is circulating in your local area, and you need to take extra precautions.</p> \\n<p>“Contact tracing is useful whether you’re infectious or not.”</p>\"}}]}],\"totalBodyBlocks\":1},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"},{\"id\":\"technology/2020/feb/26/nvidia-shield-tv-review-the-best-android-tv-box-with-brilliant-ai-upscaling\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"technology\",\"sectionName\":\"Technology\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2020-02-26T07:00:12Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Nvidia Shield TV review: the best Android TV box with brilliant AI upscaling\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/26/nvidia-shield-tv-review-the-best-android-tv-box-with-brilliant-ai-upscaling\",\"apiUrl\":\"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2020/feb/26/nvidia-shield-tv-review-the-best-android-tv-box-with-brilliant-ai-upscaling\",\"blocks\":{\"body\":[{\"id\":\"5e3ad5958f08e1332473d9c3\",\"bodyHtml\":\"<p>The Nvidia Shield TV is a refined version of the best Android TV box for years, packed with impressive new AI-based upscaling technology and a novel space-saving design.</p> <p>The new Nvidia Shield TV comes in two versions: a £149.99 media streamer and a “Pro” alternative for £199 that is aimed more at gaming.</p> <p>For those unfamiliar with these types of media streaming devices, they in effect add a smart TV experience to older televisions or replace the often terrible or out-of-date smart elements of more modern sets, so that you can use apps such as Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer and Netflix.</p> <p>Nvidia is arguably the biggest name in graphics, and also makes mobile chips called Tegra, on which these two Android TV boxes are based.

But with its redesign as a hide-away tube and with a new, much more user-friendly and smartly designed remote, the new Shield TV is not only the best streaming box for power users, but one of the very best for regular people too – right up there with the Apple TV 4K and Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K.</p> \\n<p>On most fronts it beats or matches everything else, be it support for the latest Dolby Atmos, Vision and HDR standards, app support or even the built-in 4K Chromecast support.

When it comes to work and personal productivity, every little improvement can make a difference, which is why productivity is one of the busiest categories on Google and Apple’s app stores. Some of those apps tackle the same tasks as the ones preloaded on your smartphone: calendar, contacts or notes, for example – but with better design and extra features. Others zero in on specific niches to organise your digital and/or physical life and work, from scanning and sorting your receipts or managing work projects through to planning your weekly food shopping or managing children’s pocket money. This is a list of 20 of the best apps that may help, but productivity and organising apps are subjective: if something doesn’t work for you, there are usually two or three (or even a dozen) good options that might suit you more – so browse around.\\nFamilyWall (Android/Apple, free + optional subscription) The bigger your household gets, the trickier it can be to coordinate who’s doing what when. FamilyWall is one of a cluster of family-management apps, with a shared calendar, chores and shopping lists, and messaging. A premium subscription adds more features if needed.\\nFocus (Apple, subscription) If you’re working from home for some or all of the time, Focus is a clever app for helping you manage time. It structures your day into 25-minute working chunks, with tasks and regular breaks. You can also use the app to track tasks, form housework to homework. After a three-day free trial, a subscription is required.\\nKitche (Android/Apple, free) Kitchen organisation is greatly underrated, but whether you’re just pushed for time or wanting a greener lifestyle, apps like Kitche can be a boon. You scan supermarket receipts so it knows what food you’ve bought, and then it will help you to plan meal based on what’s in the cupboards. It can also send you reminders that certain foods are nearing their use-by dates.\\nSlidebox (Android/Apple, free + optional subscription) Unless you’re ruthlessly organised with your smartphone life, at some point your device will become cluttered with photos. Slidebox is a clever way to scoot through your library deleting unwanted images, while sorting others into albums. It’s free, with a subscription removing ads and adding video support.\\nActions by Moleskine (Android/Apple, subscription) Moleskine isn’t just about physical notebooks and diaries these days: it has a range of productivity apps too. Actions is a minimalist yet colourful to-do list app as handy for work projects as for your home life. It’s simple to set up reminders for regular tasks too. This also has a free trial, then a paid subscription.\\nEvernote (Android/Apple, free + optional subscription) It’s been around since the earliest days of the app stores, but Evernote has just had a big redesign of its mobile apps to make them fit for 2020. It remains an excellent way to both take and store notes, but more importantly to find them again when you need to. A subscription offers more features and storage.\\nAnyList (Android/Apple, free + optional subscription) A basic notes app on your smartphone is fine for quick shopping lists, but a dedicated tool like AnyList offers advantages. Among them: the option to have shared shopping lists with family members or housemates, and to cross-reference with favourite recipes. A subscription adds more features for power users.\\nCardhop (Apple, £4.99) Every smartphone comes with a built-in contacts app, so why would you pay for an extra one? Cardhop’s big selling point is its ease of use and impressive design: a beautifully crafted app for sorting your contacts, adding notes, and quickly searching twhen required. It also features an electronic business card which you can share via a QR code.\\nSmart Receipts (Android/Apple, free + optional subscription) OK, so if you’re working from home you’re unlikely to be accumulating many paper receipts. But as and when that changes, Smart Receipts and apps like it are really useful for scanning receipts in and keeping on top of your expenses, whether for tax purposes or your employer. The data it collects can be exported in various spreadsheet-friendly formats.\\nToggl Track (Android/Apple, free) Particularly when working from home, the hours can blur into one.

It has a gorgeous, bright and colourful, 90Hz AMOLED screen that is 6.44in on the diagonal with FHD+ resolution, which is only 0.11in smaller than the 8.

Metallic (but plastic) sides, glass front and back, with a vertical camera lump to one side. It is extremely attractive in a light blue colour but also comes in a metallic-like grey. The curved glass back is fairly grippy, which makes the Nord feel great in the hand and easy to hold and use without a case, although a high-quality clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) case is included in the box.</p> <p>There is a USB-C port in the bottom but no headphones socket – which is more common in smartphones priced under £400 than at the top end of the market.

It comes with either 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, depending on the model. It is worth noting that the storage is the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Flash_Storage\\\">older, slower UFS 2.1 standard</a>, not the faster, newer UFS 3.0 standard that has been used in top-end smartphones since last year.</p> <p>Performance all round was very good indeed. During day-to-day usage, launching apps, switching between them, browsing in Chrome, email in Gmail, trying to avoid the dross of social media and hurriedly setting teams against tight deadlines for the final weeks of the Fantasy Premier League, I could not tell the difference between the Nord and the stellar OnePlus 8 Pro. That, in itself, is an achievement and has as much to do with well-optimised software as the processor.</p> <p>You could notice a performance difference in graphically demanding games, while trying to manage a giant spreadsheet in Google Sheets or while rapidly scrolling through very media-heavy sites but some top-end phones from rivals also struggle a little with some of those activities <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/23/oneplus-8-pro-review-the-samsung-killer-android-5g\\\">compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro</a>.</p>  <figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"8f8cdd99e142739db7d49db21559e042bb3b56bc\\\"> <img src=\\\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f8cdd99e142739db7d49db21559e042bb3b56bc/0_179_5456_3275/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"OnePlus Nord review\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">The excellent alert slider quickly switches between totally silent, vibrate and ring.</span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Battery life is also good and lasts about 32 hours, from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two, which is more than enough to make it through the toughest of days and a night out. That matches the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro’s 32-hour batteries and beats <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/01/iphone-se-review-apple-cut-price-smartphone-king\\\">Apple’s iPhone SE</a> by five hours and <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/14/google-pixel-3a-review-camera-software-bzttery-android\\\">Google’s Pixel 3a</a> by eight hours.</p> <p>That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the screen set to 90Hz and on for more than five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, browsing and using apps, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos.</p> <p>Note that it was impossible to test the effects of 5G on battery life because I do not receive 5G at my home, to which I am restricted because of the Covid-19 situation in the UK. Also, pending a software update, the phone is limited to 4G only when two sims are used at the same time.</p> <p>The Nord has OnePlus’s Warp Charge 30T super-fast wired charging, which hits 50% in 25 minutes and fully recharges the phone in an hour. Optimised charging preserves battery longevity by learning when you need a fully charged phone overnight and delays charging to 100% until just before that moment, and works with any charger, not only the one included in the box. There is no wireless charging.</p> <h2><strong>Sustainability</strong></h2> <p>OnePlus rates the battery in the Nord for 800 full-charge cycles till 80% capacity – better than the typical 500.

The £379 Nord sits under the £599 OnePlus 8 as the firm’s mid-range offering, aiming to bring everything that makes its top-end smartphones so good but at a significantly lower price. Dimensions-wise the Nord is only marginally different to the 8, being 0.2mm thicker, 0.4mm wider, 1.9mm shorter and weighing 4g more. It has a gorgeous, bright and colourful, 90Hz AMOLED screen that is 6.44in on the diagonal with FHD+ resolution, which is only 0.11in smaller than the 8. The screen is flat, rather than curved at the sides, and a dual-selfie camera peers through the screen, taking up a fair chunk of real estate in the top left corner.\\nThe rest of the phone is fairly standard for a high-end device in 2020. Metallic (but plastic) sides, glass front and back, with a vertical camera lump to one side. It is extremely attractive in a light blue colour but also comes in a metallic-like grey. The curved glass back is fairly grippy, which makes the Nord feel great in the hand and easy to hold and use without a case, although a high-quality clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) case is included in the box. There is a USB-C port in the bottom but no headphones socket – which is more common in smartphones priced under £400 than at the top end of the market. It’s not obvious from the outside that the Nord is not a £600+ smartphone. Specifications Screen: 6.44in 90Hz FHD+ AMOLED (408ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G RAM: 8 or 12GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB (UFS 2.1) Operating system: OxygenOS 10.5 (Android 10) Camera: quad rear camera: 48MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro, 5MP depth sensor; dual selfie camera: 32MP main, 8MP ultra-wide Connectivity: 5G, dual sim, wifi 5, NFC, Bluetooth 5.1 and GPS Water resistance: no rating Dimensions: 158.3 x 73.3 x 8.2 mm Weight: 184g Fast with 32 hours of battery\\nThe Nord has one of Qualcomm’s latest 5G-capable mid-range processors, the Snapdragon 765G, rather than the top-end Snapdragon 865. It comes with either 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, depending on the model. It is worth noting that the storage is the older, slower UFS 2.1 standard, not the faster, newer UFS 3.0 standard that has been used in top-end smartphones since last year. Performance all round was very good indeed. During day-to-day usage, launching apps, switching between them, browsing in Chrome, email in Gmail, trying to avoid the dross of social media and hurriedly setting teams against tight deadlines for the final weeks of the Fantasy Premier League, I could not tell the difference between the Nord and the stellar OnePlus 8 Pro. That, in itself, is an achievement and has as much to do with well-optimised software as the processor. You could notice a performance difference in graphically demanding games, while trying to manage a giant spreadsheet in Google Sheets or while rapidly scrolling through very media-heavy sites but some top-end phones from rivals also struggle a little with some of those activities compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro.\\nBattery life is also good and lasts about 32 hours, from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two, which is more than enough to make it through the toughest of days and a night out. That matches the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro’s 32-hour batteries and beats Apple’s iPhone SE by five hours and Google’s Pixel 3a by eight hours. That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the screen set to 90Hz and on for more than five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, browsing and using apps, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos. Note that it was impossible to test the effects of 5G on battery life because I do not receive 5G at my home, to which I am restricted because of the Covid-19 situation in the UK. Also, pending a software update, the phone is limited to 4G only when two sims are used at the same time. The Nord has OnePlus’s Warp Charge 30T super-fast wired charging, which hits 50% in 25 minutes and fully recharges the phone in an hour. Optimised charging preserves battery longevity by learning when you need a fully charged phone overnight and delays charging to 100% until just before that moment, and works with any charger, not only the one included in the box. There is no wireless charging. Sustainability OnePlus rates the battery in the Nord for 800 full-charge cycles till 80% capacity – better than the typical 500. Battery longevity is also aided by the firm’s optimised charging system. The smartphone is generally repairable by OnePlus in the UK, with the battery costing £12 or the screen costing £67 plus VAT and labour to replace. The firm offers a trade-in programme for purchase of the Nord, including the return of OnePlus smartphones and models from rivals. It did not comment on the use of recycled materials in its smartphones. OxygenOS 10.5\\nThe Nord ships with the same OxygenOS 10.5 based on Android 10 as the 8 and 8 Pro. Google’s Discover feed features on the home screen, alongside nice touches such as full theme support and choices for animations such as that around the fingerprint scanner. The ability to choose which icons show in the status bar is particularly useful, given the large space taken up by the dual-selfie camera in screen. OxygenOS does have a dark mode but it cannot be toggled on and off quickly, as with most smartphones. OxygenOS has developed into the best version of Android you can get on a phone, balancing features, aesthetics and speed like no other, even without a top-of-the-line processor. OxygenOS’s one long-term downside, which is common to all OnePlus phones and has been a problem for several years, is that it aggressively shuts down apps in the background more than most other manufacturers, which prolongs battery life but also delays notifications and can break functionality for some apps. I noticed delays to security camera alerts, new message notifications and fantasy football events, among others. OnePlus only offers software support for three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bimonthly schedule. Apple offers five for its iPhones, including the £400 iPhone SE, so there’s still work to be done for OnePlus. Camera\\nThe OnePlus Nord has a quad-camera system on the back, including the same 48-megapixel main camera as the OnePlus 8, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, a 2-megapixel macro camera and a depth-sensor. The main 48MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default (a 48MP mode is available) and captures some really great-looking images, with good contrast and colour in bright light and reasonable images in middling to poor light. Low-light performance is average but is helped by the dedicated Nightscape mode.

Together they produce pretty good images, with a good amount of detail, but even in good light they can be a little grainy in areas around the eyes on closer inspection. It is nice to have the ability to take a wider angle to fit more people in. Observations\\nA screen protector comes pre-applied to the phone. The haptic feedback and vibration motor is as good as that in the 8 Plus: sharp and punchy, which cannot be said for many phones at this price. Price The OnePlus Nord is available in either blue or grey, costing £379 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £469 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. For comparison, the Google Pixel 3a costs £329, the Motorola Moto G 5G Plus costs £299.99, the Apple iPhone SE costs £419, the OnePlus 8 costs £599 and the OnePlus 8 Pro costs £799. Verdict The OnePlus Nord is a very good phone full stop – and an absolute bargain at only £379. It looks the part. The screen is great. The rear main camera is great and the battery life is very good. It is just as fast, smooth and refined in day-to-day usage as OnePlus’s smartphones costing twice as much and it supports 5G, whenever that arrives in your neighbourhood.

In fact, I really can’t see why you would pay an extra £220 for the OnePlus 8 but that’s a problem for OnePlus not the consumer. Overall, the OnePlus Nord is one hell of a lot of phone for £379 and will take some beating. Pros: great 90Hz AMOLED screen, great performance, solid battery life, fast charging, great software, looks stunning in blue, good main camera, top-notch build, dual-sim, 5G, superfast in-screen fingerprint scanner. Cons: no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, no water-resistance rating, 5G disabled when using two sims, only three years of software updates, OxygenOS can break third-party app notifications.\\nOther reviews OnePlus 8 review: 5G and top performance for less OnePlus 8 Pro review: the Samsung killer Pixel 3a review: the people’s Google phone? iPhone SE review: Apple’s cut-price smartphone king iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy\",\"attributes\":{},\"published\":true,\"createdDate\":\"2020-07-23T11:19:56Z\",\"firstPublishedDate\":\"2020-07-23T11:22:42Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2020-08-03T11:12:41Z\",\"lastModifiedDate\":\"2020-08-03T11:12:41Z\",\"contributors\":[],\"elements\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"assets\":[],\"textTypeData\":{\"html\":\"<p>With the Nord, OnePlus is returning to its roots with first-class smartphones at mid-range prices, which is a very good thing.</p> \\n<p>The £379 Nord sits under the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/20/oneplus-8-review-5g-and-top-performance-for-less\\\">£599 OnePlus 8</a> as the firm’s mid-range offering, aiming to bring everything that makes its top-end smartphones so good but at a significantly lower price.</p> \\n<p>Dimensions-wise the Nord is only marginally different to the 8, being 0.2mm thicker, 0.4mm wider, 1.9mm shorter and weighing 4g more.

In fact, I really can’t see why you would pay an extra £220 for the OnePlus 8 but that’s a problem for OnePlus not the consumer.</p> \\n<p>Overall, the OnePlus Nord is one hell of a lot of phone for £379 and will take some beating.</p> \\n<blockquote> \\n <p><strong>Pros:</strong> great 90Hz AMOLED screen, great performance, solid battery life, fast charging, great software, looks stunning in blue, good main camera, top-notch build, dual-sim, 5G, superfast in-screen fingerprint scanner.</p> \\n <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, no water-resistance rating, 5G disabled when using two sims, only three years of software updates, OxygenOS can break third-party app notifications.</p> \\n</blockquote>\"}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"assets\":[{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516/0_133_5456_3275/5456.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":5456,\"height\":3275}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516/0_133_5456_3275/master/5456.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":5456,\"height\":3275,\"isMaster\":true}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516/0_133_5456_3275/2000.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":2000,\"height\":1200}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516/0_133_5456_3275/1000.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":600}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516/0_133_5456_3275/500.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":500,\"height\":300}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\",\"file\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516/0_133_5456_3275/140.jpg\",\"typeData\":{\"aspectRatio\":\"5:3\",\"width\":140,\"height\":84}}],\"imageTypeData\":{\"caption\":\"The camera lump sticking out the back of the phone in one corner means it rocks a little when being used flat on a table or desk.\",\"displayCredit\":true,\"credit\":\"Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\",\"source\":\"The Guardian\",\"photographer\":\"Samuel Gibbs\",\"alt\":\"OnePlus Nord review\",\"mediaId\":\"8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516\",\"mediaApiUri\":\"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/8c62cff4e121d5faf58be7522d8e2cf821f3c516\",\"imageType\":\"Photograph\"}},{\"type\":\"text\",\"assets\":[],\"textTypeData\":{\"html\":\"<h2><strong>Other reviews</strong></h2> \\n<ul> \\n <li><p><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/20/oneplus-8-review-5g-and-top-performance-for-less\\\">OnePlus 8 review: 5G and top performance for less</a></strong></p></li> \\n <li><p><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/23/oneplus-8-pro-review-the-samsung-killer-android-5g\\\">OnePlus 8 Pro review: the Samsung killer</a></strong></p></li> \\n <li><p><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/14/google-pixel-3a-review-camera-software-bzttery-android\\\">Pixel 3a review: the people’s Google phone?</a></strong></p></li> \\n <li><p><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/01/iphone-se-review-apple-cut-price-smartphone-king\\\">iPhone SE review: Apple’s cut-price smartphone king</a></strong></p></li> \\n <li><p><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone\\\">iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera</a></strong></p></li> \\n <li><p><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/18/fairphone-3-review-ethical-phone\\\">Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy</a></strong></p></li> \\n</ul>\"}}]}],\"totalBodyBlocks\":1},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"}]}}";
